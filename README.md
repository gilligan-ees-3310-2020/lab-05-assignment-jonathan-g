There are two files for this lab.

1. Start by reading [`lab_05_instructions.pdf`](lab_05_instructions.pdf),
   (online version [`lab-05-instructions.md`](lab-05-instructions.md) on GitHub)
   which describes things you need to know for this lab (about the R functions 
   for working with the GEOCARB model and the data that it produces, as well as 
   some useful R functions that we will use in procesing and graphing data for 
   this lab.)

   This file also has the exercises you will do for this lab.

2. When you come to lab, you will work through the exercises, and you will
   edit the file `lab_05_exercises.Rmd` to write your answers and show your
   work.

## Instructions:

* Accept this assignment.
* Clone a local copy of the file repository from github to your
  own computer.
* In your local repository, answer the exercises in the template
  `lab_05_data_exercises.Rmd`.
* When you are done, knit your `.Rmd` files into PDF files.
* Use git to commit your changes (including the edits to the `.Rmd` files
  and the new PDF files) to your local git repository.
* Push the changes from your local git repository to github.

  The last changes that you push before the due date (9:00 AM on 
  Monday, Feb. 24) will be graded.
  If you run into difficulty and need extra time, please contact Ms. Best or 
  Prof. Gilligan.

I advise using git to commit changes frequently as you work and push those 
commits to GitHub.

I also advise knitting your answers frequently to make sure that they 
knit correctly.
